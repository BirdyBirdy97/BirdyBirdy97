## Computer Languages I know/Experience (in order of most XP to least)
```
Python 3, HTML5, CSS
JavaScript
C++
Git
```
I'm currently taking the Python 100 Days of Code course by AppBrewery and have completed the HTML and CSS Crash Course with Kevin Powell on Scrimba. I've almost completed the JavaScript course on Codecademy and have done a bit with the C++ course on Codecademy, though it's been a while for both. I had previously started a course on Coursera (by Google) focusing on Automating with Python and using Git. My best finished projects are pinned.

## My Interests
```
Back End Developement
Game Developement
Inventing/Building/Creating things
Art/Cultures/Languages
Preserving Nature and Culture
```

## Where am I looking to head?

For now, the language I'm interested in learning next is probably one of the following:
```
-SQL
-Ruby
-Rust
-JavaScript
-Lua
```
I'm looking for a Back End Dev or a Web Dev position, though for the time being, I prefer Back End. I am willing and able to learn new skills/languages/software quickly, so although I'm quite green, I am extremely adaptable and amicable.

## If you're interested in working with me, hit me up! I'll get back to you as soon as possible :)
