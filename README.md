## Computer Languages I know/Experience (in order of most XP to least)
```
Python 3, HTML5, CSS
JavaScript
C++
Git
```
I'm currently taking the Python 100 Days of Code course by AppBrewery and have completed the HTML and CSS Crash Course with Kevin Powell on Scrimba. I've almost completed the JavaScript course on Codecademy and have done a bit with the C++ course on Codecademy, though it's been a while for both. I had previously started a course on Coursera (by Google) focusing on Automating with Python and using Git. 

I have most of my own personal website coded start to finish with CSS and HTML5, but am waiting to publish it for when I can build a functioning shopping cart. My most recent/impressive projects are pinned.

## My Interests
```
Back End Developement
Inventing/Building/Creating things
Art/Cultures/Languages
Preserving Nature and Culture
Puzzles
Beading, Watercolour Painting, and Playing Guitar
Astronomy
```

## Human Skills
```
Speak English, conversational French (B2 Canadian Level), and am learning Anishnaabemowin
Learn quickly and appreciate constructive criticism
Work well in a team and am easy to get along with
Pull my weight in a team to the best of my ability
Always thinking of better ways to complete an action
Work well independantly and don't need to be micro-managed
Independant starter and can reliably complete tasks in a team or alone 
Great communication skills and won't leave the team/manager/boss in the dark as to my progress with a task
```

## Where am I looking to head?

For now, the language I'm interested in learning next is probably one of the following:
```
-SQL
-Ruby
-Rust
-JavaScript
-Lua
```
I'm looking for a Back End Dev or a Web Dev position, though for the time being, I prefer Back End. I am willing and able to learn new skills/languages/software quickly, so although I'm quite green, I am extremely adaptable and amicable.

## If you're interested in working with me, hit me up! I'll get back to you as soon as possible :)
