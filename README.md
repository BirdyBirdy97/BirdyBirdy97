- Hi, I’m @BirdyBirdy97, I go by Rose and Raven
- I’m interested in astronomy, beading, back end developement, watercolour, and playing the guitar.
- I’m currently learning Python and can build websites unprofessionally in HTML and CSS (lol) I have dabbled with C++, enough to understand mostly what I'm looking at, but not quite enough yet to build anything.
- I'm building my first website, an online store, at the moment :) I'm also taking the 100 Days of Code Python course on Udemy and plan on getting my CompTIA cert afterwards
- As for human languages, I speak English, French, and am learning Nishnaabemowin.
- How to reach me: code.raqoon@gmail.com
